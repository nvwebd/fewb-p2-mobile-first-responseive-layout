# Front End Web Development - Project 2 - Mobile First Resposive Layout

## Instructions

1. **Create your file structure:**
    - Create an index.html and styles.css file.
    - Create a folder called css and put your styles.css file inside of it. The name of the folder should not be
      capitalized.
    - Link the styles.css file to index.html

2. ** Build the layout using a mobile first design: **
    - Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document. See Configuring the Viewport
      to understand why and how to add this tag.
    - Look at the provided mockup for the mobile device and add the same header, titles, content and footer information
      into your index.html file.
    - Use the provided images for the portfolio gallery images shown in the mockups.
    - Use a font from Google Fonts for the text.
    - Use CSS to style your layout to match the provided mobile mockup. Make sure your mobile design matches the mockup
      at 320px screen size.

3. **Once you have everything in place for the mobile layout, use media queries to add breakpoints to adjust the
   layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.**

    - Match the design as it should look on a tablet device that is 768px wide and a desktop screen size that is 1024px
      wide.
    - Use a mobile-first approach by writing your media queries using the min-width property in your CSS.

4. **Once all your breakpoints are in place, double check your layout matches the three mockups.**

    - The design does not need to be exact, but the general spacing and arrangement of the elements should match the
      design of the mockups for mobile, tablet and desktop.
    - Feel free to replace the profile image and customize the text, but the layouts should match the mockups.
