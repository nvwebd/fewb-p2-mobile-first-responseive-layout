# Front End Web Development - Project 2 - Mobile First Resposive Layout

## Instructions

1. **Create your file structure:**
    - Create an index.html and styles.css file.
    - Create a folder called css and put your styles.css file inside of it. The name of the folder should not be capitalized.
    - Link the styles.css file to index.html

2. ** Build the layout using a mobile first design: **
   - Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document. See Configuring the Viewport to understand why and how to add this tag.
   - Look at the provided mockup for the mobile device and add the same header, titles, content and footer information into your index.html file.
   - Use the provided images for the portfolio gallery images shown in the mockups.
   - Use a font from Google Fonts for the text.
   - Use CSS to style your layout to match the provided mobile mockup. Make sure your mobile design matches the mockup at 320px screen size.

3. **Once you have everything in place for the mobile layout, use media queries to add breakpoints to adjust the 
   layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.**
